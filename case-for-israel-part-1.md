DNA studies have determined that ALL biological Jews of the various subdivisions--Ashkenazim, Mizrahim and Sephardim--are related to one another. ALL biological Jews have also been determined to have genetic roots in the Southern Levant and are related to the Canaanites.

Archaeology has repeatedly confirmed that the Jewish peoples originated in the Southern Levant thousands of years prior to Arabs leaving the Arabian Peninsula. Archaeology has also repeatedly confirmed that the presence of Arabs and the Arabic language in the Middle East and North Africa everywhere outside of the Arabian Peninsula, including the Southern Levant where Israel is situated, is the result of past imperialist colonialist expansions and forced assimilations. 

Historic records repeatedly emphasize not only the Indigenous presence of Jews in the Southern Levant, but the fact that there remained a number of them in the Southern Levant to meet every outside group which came into the region, including Arabs. Even Arabic and Ottoman Empire historical records confirm that Jews were in the Southern Levant before them.

Case in point, the historic and linguistic origins of the name, "Jew." European languages call Jews "Jude," "Jew," etc, because they are shortened derivations from "Judean." A "Judean" is a native of "Judea" which was one the historic Jewish nations in the Southern Levant which predates Arabs arriving in the Southern Levant. Even the terms that Arabic speakers use for Jews, "Yahud" and "Yahudi," testify that Jews are the Indigenous population of the Southern Levant. As there is no "J" sound in Hebrew, the actual name of "Judea" was "Yahuda." A "Yahud" or "Yahudi" is a native of the historical Southern Levantine nation of "Yahuda." Descendants of Egyptian Mizrahim Jews, frequently get called "Yahud" by Arabs in the US despite not publicly wearing any outward signs because they recognize the phenotype.

Rome--an imperialist colonialist power not indigenous to the Southern Levant--erasing the linkages between Jews--ie Judeans--and their homeland--Judea--by renaming it Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba Revolt to punish the Jews--ie Judeans. Then, the British Empire--an imperialist colonialist power not indigenous to the Southern Levant--renamed the region, Palestine.

Also reference the historical documentation of the Ottoman Empire--a Middle Eastern Imperialist colonialist power--which records that they shipped European converts to Islam from the Balkans, Russia and Ukraine to the Southern Levant as colonialists where they ended up assimilated into Arabic language and culture. Historical records, genealogies, genetic tests and even surnames indicate that Palestinian Arabs' families came from various parts of the Middle East and North Africa. This can be seen with such surnames as "al Masri" and "al Misr" which indicates that their families were from Egypt. It can be seen in surnames such as "al Tikrit" and "al Mosul" which indicate that those families came from the cities of Tikrit and Mosul in Iraq. It also can be seen in the surname "al Hind" which indicates that those families came from the India-Pakistan-Bangladesh region. It can be seen in clan names which have been documented to have originated on the Arabian Peninsula in what is now Saudi Arabia, such as "Erakat" and "Harbi."  Historical records document that a minority of the founding population of today's Palestinian Arabs were Indigenous Jews, Indigenous Christians, Indigenous Druze and the descendants of Roman and European Crusader colonists whom were forcibly converted to Islam and forcibly assimilated into Arabic language and culture by past imperialist colonialism.

Indigenous Jews were illegally ethnic cleansed from what is now Palestinian Authority controlled territory and eastern Jerusalem during Jordan's illegal invasion and illegal occupation despite the Indigenous Jews being there for centuries before Arabs left the Arabian Peninsula. It ignores the fact that Jordan illegally replaced the Indigenous Jews there with its Arab citizens whom its rulers decided to exile. Egypt, during it's illegal invasion and illegal occupation of Gaza, treated Gaza like an open air prison by exiling its prisoners there. 

Hamas and the Palestinian Authority violate human rights, the women's rights, the LGBTQ rights and the religous rights of their citizens. They do not allow elections. Villages like that of US Representative Rashida Harbi Tlaib's grandmother aren't allowed to choose their own village leaders, the Palestinian Authority chooses them. And what they call "Israeli occupation" isn't occupying their territories. It is controlling border regions to keep weapons away from them and terrorists out of Israeli territory. Otherwise, Israel lets Hamas and the Palestinian Authority control their own territories.

Historical documentation records that Jews from all of the major divisions of the Jewish peoples--Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Mizrahim--had ties with the Jews whom never left the Southern Levant. Ties which included intermarriage and moving there to join their Southern Levantine relatives centuries before modern Israel was refounded.  Historic documentation records that the British Empire--which is not indigenous to the Southern Levant--in addition to allowing Arabs to illegally immigrate to the "Territory of Palestine" where they weren't indigenous also actively tried to prevent Jews from joining their Indigenous relatives in the Territory despite the international mandate which recognized the Territory as the Jewish homeland and required the British to facilitate Jewish resettlement there as the returning Indigenous population, not Arabs. Thus, it is the Palestinian Arabs whom are in the Southern Levant as the result of imperialist colonialism, not Jews. Jews are there as the result of the Zionist Indigenous rights movement despite imperialist colonialism.

Human rights are afforded to its citizens by Israel. Israel protects religious rights, women's rights and LGBTQ rights. By way of contrast, the Arab powers surrounding Israel, including the Palestinian Authority and Hamas in Gaza, persecutes LGBTQ and non-Muslims which has resulted in refugees seeking asylum in Israel. This is in contrast to the violations of women's rights in the Arab powers surrounding Israel. Similarly there is a Apartheid ethnic cleansing of JIMENA (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa), such as my Egyptian Jewish ancestors, from Arab nations and from the parts of Gaza and from the parts of Palestinian Authority controlled territories which Indigenous Jews once lived in for centuries before Arabs left the Arabian Peninsula.

Over half of Israel's Jewish population consists of JIMENA whose families were forcibly, and in some cases genocidally, expelled from Muslim countries. The public should not ignore the Apartheid restrictions which non-Muslims have to live under in Arab nations. 

You can't ignore the genocide that Assad's Syria committed against a Palestinian Arab refugee camp. Similarly, the Apartheid restrictions which Arab nations place on Palestinian Arab refugees in their countries which deny them paths to citizenship, the rights to movement within the countries, the rights to certain educational training and the rights to work in certain careers. Israel allows Arab--Christian and Muslim--citizens to live where they choose, worship as they choose as long as they respect the rights of others, be educated as they choose, work in the careers of their choice, serve in the military and serve in the government.

There is a history of the Arab world's wars with Israel. It was the Arab nations whom forced Palestinian Arabs to leave the region and become refugees after the Arab powers attacked Israel. Israel assimilated the JIMENA whom were expelled from Muslim countries--whom incidentally outnumbered the Palestinian Arabs whom became refugees. The Arab nations whom forced Palestinian Arabs to flee and become refugees have refused to assimilate those refugees and actively persecutes them.

The long history of Palestinian Arabs committing acts of violence against Jews predates the re-founding of modern Israel and continues until today. Hajj Amin al Husseini, a former Jerusalem Mufti, incited violent attacks on Jews during the 1920s and 1930s. And during WW2, he joined the Nazis, talked the Nazis into killing European Jews instead of deporting them to what is now Israel, became the Nazi's Arab world propagandist and led an all Bosnian SS Einsatzgruppen unit which rounded up and mass shot Eastern European Jews. You can't ignore the genocidal statement of intent against Jews worldwide in Hamas's founding charter. 

Many Western Palestinian protestor’s chants could be perceived to be incitement against Israel and Jews by mischaracterizing the Zionist Indigenous rights movement of Jews as colonialism and imperialism when all of the evidence supports the Jews as being the Indigenous population of the region, not the Palestinian Arabs. By mischaracterizing the Palestinian Arabs as the indigenous population of the region when all of the evidence supports that they are there as the result of past imperialist colonialism, this instructor's email creates the false impression that Jews are the colonialist aggressors in the region as the result of imperialism against whom an indigenous population is resisting. When in reality, it is the Jews whom are the Indigenous population whom is resisting the aggression of colonialist Palestinian Arabs in the region as the result of multiple instances of imperialist colonialism. 

Never must genocidal attacks be condoned nor downplayed. Never must violations of human rights and war crimes be condoned nor downplayed. And attacking, torturing, killing, raping, beheading and kidnapping civilians ARE human rights violations and war crimes. Attacking women, children and the elderly as Hamas has done is forbidden by the Quran.

Under actual international laws of warfare Hamas is the aggressor, because they attacked Israel without provocation. Under international laws of warfare Hamas committed war crimes during their attacks. It is illegal for Hamas to target Israeli civilian centers specifically targeting women, children and the elderly. Under international laws of warfare Hamas is responsible for the deaths of Palestinian Arabs in Gaza whom die as a result of Israeli retaliation, because Hamas is illegally using them as human shields. Under international laws of warfare it is illegal for Hamas to place rocket launchers, military installations, weapons and munitions in highly populated areas such as they do in northern Gaza in, under and near mosques, schools, churches, hospitals, etc.
